{"name":"Bezier","tagline":"A JavaScript-only bezier implementation with good performance.","body":"#bezier.js\r\n##introduction\r\n`bezier.js`,is a fast and light-weight implementation of bezier curve in pure JavaScript.\r\n\r\n**size**: `~4kb` unminified, `~2kb` minified.   \r\n**performance**: near native implementation(or even greater)   \r\n**controllable**: full controllable   \r\n**usable range**: all nth order bezier curves, and even some curves like 6th order the x coords but 8th order the y coords.   \r\n**transparency**: you can see every result of computing, nothing is hidden\r\n##inside\r\nBezier curves can be implemented like parametric plotting, and the plotting function is controlled by the control points. `bezier.js` does all of this for you, with everything transparent. We compile a curve into two high-performance javascript functions,one is x and the other is y, then call them every time with a specified value `t` as parameter, and get `x` value and `y` value. Then we get these points, and plot them on the canvas.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
